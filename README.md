# Haikus for Michole n Ilya

This is a quick node project to mark an unexpected facetime call with my sister and good friend. ChatGPT generated the haiku and Midjourney did the images. The template  is based on the [Azure node sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/nodejs-docs-hello-world). Thank you Github Codespaces!
